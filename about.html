                        <h4>Little Story</h4>
                        <p>The construction of the hotel was commissioned by Tata. Its doors opened to guests on 16
                            December 1903.

                            An oft-repeated story concerning the reasoning behind the construction of the hotel was
                            Jamsetji Tata's refusal into the Watson's Hotel due to it being reserved for Europeans, but
                            the validity of this has been challenged by writer Charles Allen, who wrote that Tata was
                            unlikely to care about such a slight to the extent that he would construct a new hotel.
                            Instead, Allen writes, the Taj was built at the urging of editor of The Times of India who
                            felt a hotel "worthy of Bombay" was needed and as a "gift to the city he loved" by Tata.[12]

                        <p>The original Indian architects were Sitaram Khanderao Vaidya and D. N. Mirza, and the
                            project was completed by an English engineer, W. A. Chambers. The builder was Khansaheb
                            Sorabji Ruttonji Contractor who also designed and built its famous central floating
                            staircase. The cost of construction was £250,000 (£127 million in 2008 prices). </p>
                        <p>Between 1915 and 1919, work proceeded at Apollo Bundar to reclaim the land behind the hotel
                            where the Gateway of India was built in 1924. the Gateway of India soon became a major focal
                            point in Bombay. </p>
